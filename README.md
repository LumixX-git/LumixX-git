## What I Do And Who I Am

Hi! My name is Mila (however I legally go by Parker. I am waiting to be able to change my name)!
I often program in Haxe and/or lua, but I am open to learn new things.
If you wish to contact me I reccomend talking to me on Discord. It's the fastest way to talk to me.
Currently I am in high school trying to get into collage so I can get a degree in video game programming.
As of right now I'm in the Hawktimus Prime robotics team. 
You can check out their repo's by looking at what organizations I'm in. 
I enjoy speaking to people, even if I can have some social anxiety! I can be nice and talkative once I get to know you so be slow with me! I can also be really nice just don't bring up things I don't like (for example look at my carrd). I was initially a boy but I didn't like being what I was so I have wanted to transition over to a girl. It makes me feel happier when I feel supported and given the proper care needed, it makes me feel safe and cozy when I have people I know who are accepting towards me. I'm also in love with Japan and their culture! It's a dream of mine to get a job over there and live there. I am also the middle child in my family with me being 15! Also yes I'm a furry, but I have learned that while it may be a strange thing, it indeed can be fun! My fursona is a bunny because I think they are so fricken silly and cute like look at this bunny below!

This is pretty much everything you need to know about me!
