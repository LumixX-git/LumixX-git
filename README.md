## Hi I'm the programmer that will make you blame me for everything!

I tend to program in Haxe, C#, and C++ but I am open to learn new things.
If you wish to contact me I reccomend talking to me on Discord. It's the fastest way to talk to me.
Currently I am in high school trying to get into collage so I can get a degree in video game programming.
As of right now I'm in the Hawktimus Prime robotics team. 
You can check out their repo's by looking at what organizations I'm in.
